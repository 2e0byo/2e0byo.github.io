There are all kinds of fun exploits people use to get into systems they&rsquo;re not supposed to be in. In my case they used ssh. Normally ssh is secure. None of my passwords are brute-forceable. (Yes, you shouldn&rsquo;t have public-facing password ssh&mldr; but that&rsquo;s no fun when you&rsquo;re on someone else&rsquo;s computer and need to get in in a hurry.)

This, apparently, is down to the fact that
Basic authentication is no longer secure enough to support modern working as it does not support security features such as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).

Obviously, it should not look like this. What follows is a post-mortem, because it is worth learning from one&rsquo;s mistakes.
The final moments of a fridge After fixing the defrost I did not get around to replacing the blown thermal fuse. The Chinese sensors were supplied with some kind of wire which breaks if you so much as look at it, and I was afraid I would knock the wire at some point and crash the system.

The plane started out rather rusty, as did the iron (why do I always forget to take &lsquo;before&rsquo; photos?). The plane sole, lubricated with water, was used to flatten off the soft building block, and it was then used to take the rust off the iron.
