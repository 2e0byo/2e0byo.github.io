the place. In the meantime the fridge compartment turned into a
freezer, albeit not a very good one. Time to take it apart and see
what the problem could be.</p><h1 id=cooling-system>Cooling System</h1><p>This fridge-freezer has one fan, two thermistors (one in each
compartment), one heat exchange (at the top of the freezer
compartment), a duct around the heat exchange/fan which causes air to
be drawn from the bottom of the freezer compartment and blown out at
the top, recirculating via the door, a &lsquo;superfreeze&rsquo; button which
causes it get colder quicker (or possibly just colder) and is to be
used &lsquo;when the ambient temperature is below 16 degrees or you want to
freeze fresh food&rsquo; and should be used &lsquo;only for 24 hours, but always
if the ambient temperature is below 16 degrees&rsquo;, a light (in the
fridge compartment), a door switch (in the fridge compartment), an
uncalibrated knob to set the fridge temperature, and a power
indicator, which never comes on. Attached to heat exchange is a
defrosting coil and a thermal fuse, and another defrosting coil is in
the polystyrene insulation directly below the heat exchange and in the
duct.</p><p>For pictures of all this, see the <a href=https://2e0byo.github.io/post/repairs/how-to-break-a-freezer>previous
post</a>.</p><p>There is a control board at the very top of the freezer, in the same
plastic membrane which supports the top door hinge. Every design
decision here seems to be about cutting cost (why no third metal
hinge?) and the plastic had become brittle, but despite snapping the
clips taking it off the two screws seem to hold the door rigidly
enough.</p><p>I removed the top membrane, cut notches in it where the two bundles of
wires come out to meet the control board, removed (at the cost of a
screwdrive gashing a fingertip) the control board from the membrane
and reattached it with everything poked up on top. Now we can fiddle
with the controller without having to take the fridge apart each
time. Here is a poor photo of the control board:</p><div class=box><figure itemprop=associatedMedia itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/ImageObject><div class=img><img itemprop=thumbnail src=https://2e0byo.github.io/img/20210118_145551.jpg alt=/img/20210118_145551.jpg></div><a href=https://2e0byo.github.io/img/20210118_145551.jpg itemprop=contentUrl></a></figure></div><p>and here is the other side, with the microcontroller:</p><div class=box><figure itemprop=associatedMedia itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/ImageObject><div class=img><img itemprop=thumbnail src=https://2e0byo.github.io/img/20210118_145734.jpg alt=/img/20210118_145734.jpg></div><a href=https://2e0byo.github.io/img/20210118_145734.jpg itemprop=contentUrl></a></figure></div><p>Alas, that&rsquo;s a manufacturer-specific partnumber and I have no idea
what this is, but probably an 8-bitter (or maybe it&rsquo;s just a bunch of
comparitors and not an MCU at all?). There goes the dream of hooking
up an STLink and flashing new firmware. Still, it&rsquo;s likely not the
firmware (if there is any) which has gone.</p><p>We&rsquo;re lucky enough to have another fridge and freezer, so I decamped
everything and turned it off. Then I took the ducting off. It was
frozen solid and took a hairdryer to move. Once off it was clear what
had happened:</p><div class=box><figure itemprop=associatedMedia itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/ImageObject><div class=img><img itemprop=thumbnail src=https://2e0byo.github.io/img/20210118_170448.jpg alt=/img/20210118_170448.jpg></div><a href=https://2e0byo.github.io/img/20210118_170448.jpg itemprop=contentUrl></a></figure></div><p>That&rsquo;s ice, all along the back, right up to where it hit the inside of
the compartment. No wonder it wouldn&rsquo;t come. The overflow tube is a
solid icycle. The heat exchange, crucially, looks fine however:</p><div class=box><figure itemprop=associatedMedia itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/ImageObject><div class=img><img itemprop=thumbnail src=https://2e0byo.github.io/img/20210118_170730.jpg alt=/img/20210118_170730.jpg></div><a href=https://2e0byo.github.io/img/20210118_170730.jpg itemprop=contentUrl></a></figure></div><p>The coil in the foreground is the heater, the wire is to the
thermistor and the the thermal fuse is on the other side.</p><h1 id=testing>Testing</h1><p>What had gone wrong? My first guess was that either the fan had
failed or one or both of the heating coils. The heat exchange wasn&rsquo;t
frozen solid and the heater attached to it measured only a few ohms,
so it wasn&rsquo;t that. The other heater was rather less inspiring at 6k,
but 6k is not an open circuit and looked plausible. I thus took it
upstairs, put it on a towel, and rigged up an experiment:</p><div class=box><figure itemprop=associatedMedia itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/ImageObject><div class=img><img itemprop=thumbnail src=https://2e0byo.github.io/img/20210118_172959.jpg alt=/img/20210118_172959.jpg></div><a href=https://2e0byo.github.io/img/20210118_172959.jpg itemprop=contentUrl></a></figure></div><p>The multimeter is a Vichy VC99 with optoisolated serial output added
to it, but multimeter hacking is for another post. Mains arrives by
the black wire.</p><p>Well that clearly didn&rsquo;t work, but I briefly saw 150mA being drawn.
Perhaps it&rsquo;s the connection? With some 2.5mm^2 wire bent and pushed
in it started going:</p><div class=box><figure itemprop=associatedMedia itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/ImageObject><div class=img><img itemprop=thumbnail src=https://2e0byo.github.io/img/20210118_173750.jpg alt=/img/20210118_173750.jpg></div><a href=https://2e0byo.github.io/img/20210118_173750.jpg itemprop=contentUrl></a></figure></div><p>Which is actually a test of the <em>fan</em>, as you can see. The fan works;
the heater works too:</p><div class="gallery caption-position-bottom caption-effect-fade hover-effect-zoom hover-transition" itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/ImageGallery><div class=box><figure itemprop=associatedMedia itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/ImageObject><div class=img style=background-image:url(https://2e0byo.github.io//img/heater_log.png)><img itemprop=thumbnail src=https://2e0byo.github.io/img/heater_log.png alt=/img/heater_log.png></div><a href=https://2e0byo.github.io/img/heater_log.png itemprop=contentUrl></a></figure></div><div class=box><figure itemprop=associatedMedia itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/ImageObject><div class=img style=background-image:url(https://2e0byo.github.io//img/current_heater_log.png)><img itemprop=thumbnail src=https://2e0byo.github.io/img/current_heater_log.png alt=/img/current_heater_log.png></div><a href=https://2e0byo.github.io/img/current_heater_log.png itemprop=contentUrl></a></figure></div></div><p>Apologies for the screenshot. SmuView&rsquo;s saving is currently broken
and I haven&rsquo;t had time to look at it.</p><p>Fan draws less than 50mA with a noticeable startup spike (probably
higher as the multimeter only samples every 0.6s), heater draws 150mA.</p><p>So that can&rsquo;t be it. Why, then, were they not getting switched on? I
had another look at the controller board. It has a large 100nF
capacitor, presumably as a capacitative power supply. It has a 12v
relay, a lot of transistors, SCRs (or mosfets? But would have to be
two/output if so, so unlikely), some high-power resistors (second
power supply for the logic?) and handfull of passives, most notably
varistors. What could go? The relay is for the compressor (highest
current load). So the rest are on SCRs, which <em>can</em> go; or perhaps
its a transistor somewhere?</p><p>As it happens, I&rsquo;ve always wanted to build a fridge controller. So
let&rsquo;s just reverse-engineer the connections and start from scratch.</p><h1 id=reverse-engineering>Reverse Engineering</h1><h2 id=fridge-operation>Fridge Operation</h2><p>There is no air-channel from the freezer to the fridge. So the usual
blow-air-from-freezer block-channel approach can&rsquo;t be in use. What
else could it be? I was stumped for ages until I realised the
insulation under the heat exchange is partly to insulate the <em>freezer</em>
from the heat exchange. So the fridge is called by direct contact
with the heat exchange + convection. Colder fridge = run compressor
for longer. That explains why turning the <em>fridge</em> temperature to the
lowest setting did cool the <em>freezer</em>, but froze the fridge.</p><h2 id=freezer-operation>Freezer Operation</h2><p>How does the freezer cool, then? I was stumped a bit further, and
wondered if they were doing something horrible like using a heater to
stop it getting too cold (&lsquo;icebox in fridge&rsquo; fridges actually do
this). Then I realised that the freezer will basically not cool if
the fan doesn&rsquo;t run, or if the airway is blocked. So run the fan =
cool the freezer. The aggressive defrosting is to prevent exactly
what has been happening.</p><p>How long do we defrost for? This will require some experimentation,
but the presence of a thermal fuse suggests a reasonable time (unless
it&rsquo;s just a statutory requirement). The thermistor on the heat
exchange should give us useful data on that.</p><h2 id=wiring>Wiring</h2><p>This was rather time-consuming and is specific to this fridge, but I
eventually found I have two thermistors, one in each compartment, with
a room-temperature resistance of around 20k and a negative temperature
coefficient (tested with a hairdryer). Then there&rsquo;s a connection for
the lamp, power, connection to the heaters (which are in parallel,
with a thermal fuse in series on each leg), the motor, the door
switch, and separate switch for the &lsquo;quick freeze&rsquo; option, which is
wired directly to a tap on the compressor motor and probably just
makes the compressor run faster. So to control everything we need to
switch:</p><ul><li>the compressor (10A on their relay)</li><li>the &lsquo;go fast&rsquo; (10A to be safe)</li><li>the light</li><li>the fan</li><li>the heaters</li></ul><p>and recieve input from:</p><ul><li>the door (digital)</li><li>the fridge thermistor (analogue)</li><li>the freezer thermistor (analogue)</li></ul><p>That&rsquo;s 5 relays or SCRs (but I have no SCRs). Fortunately I have an
old microwave controller with relays galore:</p><div class=box><figure itemprop=associatedMedia itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/ImageObject><div class=img><img itemprop=thumbnail src=https://2e0byo.github.io/img/20210118_200724.jpg alt=/img/20210118_200724.jpg></div><a href=https://2e0byo.github.io/img/20210118_200724.jpg itemprop=contentUrl></a></figure></div><p>These are 24V relays, but 5*5 = 25, which is close enough, and a 5x
voltage multiplier is easy enough. Switching current on the large
relays is 50mA however, but with a soft-hold we can save current (so
long as we don&rsquo;t switch too many at once).</p><p>Time for part two: <a href=https://2e0byo.github.io/post/engineering/reverse-engineering-fridge2>writing a fridge controller</a>.</p></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=https://2e0byo.github.io/post/coding/cleaning-scanned-pdfs/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Cleaning Scanned Pdfs">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=https://2e0byo.github.io/post/engineering/reverse-engineering-fridge2/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Reverse Engineering a Fridge: Part 2">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href=mailto:2e0byo@gmail.com title="Email me"><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
