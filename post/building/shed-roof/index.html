Unfortunately when we moved in the torched on felt (the proper
three-layer system) had died in a large part, and water could make its way
inside. Thus it needed re-roofing.</p><p>Now, whilst I have no experience roofing beyond tacking down felt on wooden
roofs (which is infinitely simpler than what ended up happening), I immediately
decided to volunteer to re-roof it if the landlord would pay. And since it made
no sense to do <em>one</em> side, I offered to do the neighbour&rsquo;s half as well (the
shed is semi-detached). The reasoning at the time was that a proper reroofing
job would be at least a grand, and the landlord was unlikely to volunteer that
for a small leak. More likely he would put some sealer on; the problem would
reappear; etc. (I have no evidence this would actually be the case as I did not
ask him. But it&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d likely do if someone said the shed was
leaking&mdash;repair it for a year or so and try to get friendly with a roofer in
the meanwhile.) Whereas I wanted to know the tools and wood inside were
properly dry. And besides, I&rsquo;d never done anything of the kind.</p><p>The options, then, were:</p><ul><li>seal with some (GRP?) roof sealant and hope for the best</li><li>hire/buy roofing torch, roller, etc and do a 3-layer system as before</li><li>strip the roof and replace with a modern GRP roof-in-a-can</li><li>strip the roof and put down shed felt</li><li>strip the roof, seal it with bitumen sealer, apply a thick bitumen paint
layer, and then felt as a top layer</li></ul><p>Whilst the modern GRP roofing processes are supposed to last for ever and be
completely leak free, where do you go if they go wrong? You can&rsquo;t exactly buy
the stuff at B&Q. Torching was out&mdash;I&rsquo;ve seen a roof burned out in a reroofing
job, and I&rsquo;ve no desire to try to explain that to the landlord. Just slapping
down shed felt feels horrible when the current finish has lasted so long. So I
went with the latter option.</p><p>Firstly, I needed a ladder. They were all rather expensive, so this was knocked
together:</p><link rel=stylesheet href=https://2e0byo.github.io/css/hugo-easy-gallery.css><div class=box><figure itemprop=associatedMedia itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/ImageObject><div class=img><img itemprop=thumbnail src=https://2e0byo.github.io/img/roof/ladder.jpg alt=/img/roof/ladder.jpg></div><a href=https://2e0byo.github.io/img/roof/ladder.jpg itemprop=contentUrl></a></figure></div><p>Then Lidl had a decent ladder on offer, so I carried one home. Two ladders
doesn&rsquo;t do any harm, after all.</p><p>The bitumen sealer is a thin paint, more like wood
stain. It waterproofs the concrete largely so the next layer will take without
soaking in, but it does provide a degree of sealing in the cracks.</p><div class=box><figure itemprop=associatedMedia itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/ImageObject><div class=img><img itemprop=thumbnail src=https://2e0byo.github.io/img/roof/primer.jpg alt=/img/roof/primer.jpg></div><a href=https://2e0byo.github.io/img/roof/primer.jpg itemprop=contentUrl></a></figure></div><p>The bitumen paint, on the other hand, is a thick, viscous layer applied &lsquo;with
brush or mop&rsquo;. It forms a layer all in itself, about 3/8" to 1/2" thick. When
tacky the felt is placed on top (and rolled down with another roll of felt,
since I lacked a roller). The felt was the thickest, longest life no-torch felt
I could find, specced for 15 years. Since even a torched roof is only supposed
to last 20 years without work, and frequently lasts no longer than 15, I didn&rsquo;t
feel too bad about that.</p><p>This bitumen paint is horrible stuff. The professionals use it if torching
isn&rsquo;t possible. It comes in horrible big drums, and after half an hour the
solvent had sent me completely light-headed (hold on when using ladders).</p><div class=box><figure itemprop=associatedMedia itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/ImageObject><div class=img><img itemprop=thumbnail src=https://2e0byo.github.io/img/roof/bonding.jpg alt="This photo is safe to have on the internet until they develop painting-gait analysis software."></div><a href=https://2e0byo.github.io/img/roof/bonding.jpg itemprop=contentUrl></a><figcaption><p>This photo is safe to have on the internet until they develop painting-gait analysis software.</p></figcaption></figure></div><p>But worse even than that was clearing off the old felt. Most of it came fine,
but a portion&mdash;about 1/3 of the roof&mdash;was still stuck down (i.e. 2/3 was
flapping loose). Roofers have a proper tool for scraping off old felt&mdash;and of
course can apply heat. I had a handheld paint scraper. It took several hours
and left my right arm and wrist very sore. But once you&rsquo;ve started a job like
this you have to finish.</p><p>Then the felt was folded round and glued down, but I was running out of bitumen
paint, and the wind was fighting me. I cut it in a hurry with scissors&mdash;none
too straight&mdash;and cleared up the worst of the bitumen run off. Then later I
fitted a fascia board, guttering and a downpipe.</p><h2 id=postmortem>Postmortem</h2><p>All in all there were around 20 heavy-duty black sacks of rubbish when I&rsquo;d
finished, not including all the clothes I&rsquo;d worn, the brushes, gloves and paint
drums. The ladders were cleaned up a bit with white spirit; then the wooden was
just painted over and the metal eventually cleaned with tar remover the
neighbour gave me. A few things would have made life easier:</p><ul><li>Clamping the side of the felt whilst it glues needs attention <em>before</em>
starting work (I ended up making up jigs whilst it dripped).</li><li>Better is to fold round and glue underneath, even if it does mean losing the
(cast) drip rail. That way you can just use G-clamps.</li><li>Just because the torched on stuff hung straight down doesn&rsquo;t mean yours has to
(you can just crease it to make an overhang).</li><li>Don&rsquo;t do anything with bitumen paint, ever. It is pretty good though</li><li>Guttering covers a multitude of sins.</li><li>So does screwing a rain guide board on to the edge. But that would require
making fixing holes <em>first</em>.</li><li>Bitumen will never, ever, come out of anything it touches. Fortunately the
landlord doesn&rsquo;t seem to care about the odd streamers which made it onto the
fence. I got the worst off.</li></ul></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=https://2e0byo.github.io/post/engineering/zip/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Overzealous Zip Repair">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=https://2e0byo.github.io/post/electronics/motorcycle-alarm/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Motorcycle Alarm">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href=mailto:2e0byo@gmail.com title="Email me"><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
