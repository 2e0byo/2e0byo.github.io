The internet in Durham, which was allowing me to use the workstation there remotely, has gone down; support tell me to &lsquo;turn it off and on again&rsquo;. But obviously I can&rsquo;t do that remotely. Ah well, it wasn&rsquo;t really needed. But what if it were? I&rsquo;ve run servers over unreliable wifi links with good uptime before, with a failsafe script which rebooted everything if it couldn&rsquo;t ping the gateway for too long—and looking at the logs, sometimes it was needed.

I started this peice of test equipment when I was about 15, I think, built the timebase with enthusiasm, the counting chain with a bit less, and then wondered how on earth I was to attach the 7-segment displays. Surely not one wire each?! So the project languished, and eventually got relegated to the shelf without ever being finished. All I had was the breadboard and two schematics which nearly corresponded with what was in front of me:

This is a very simple project indeed: add a line-in input feeding the amplifier in my sister&rsquo;s CD/Tape/Radio, which has much better sound than the &lsquo;device&rsquo; she mainly plays music from. How hard can it be to find the amplifier IC and feed in directly?
Taking the thing apart was none too hard, and it&rsquo;s cheap &rsquo;90s hardware so all through-hole and single-sided PCB. I found the mode switch, traced it back to the amplifier, paid careful attention to the pinouts and soldered a small cable onto one input, the other end going to a 555 &lsquo;signal generator&rsquo; kit I had lying around.

A while ago I made one of those vices used for bookbinding which is called a &lsquo;lying press&rsquo;, not because it is used to print articles for the Lügendpresse, whoever that might be, but because it is a press and lies down, in a bench called a tub. There are many drawings, etc, all over the internet. My press is a little different: I used old windowsill &lsquo;mahogany&rsquo;, and took advantage of the profile to make one side a &lsquo;backing press&rsquo; with protruding jaws planed away after a picture I found in an old book somewhere.

By this point we have all we need for a basic charge, and I do actually need to charge some batteries. I can build a simple current regulator with an LM317 and a resistor, which will be good enough for now.
No Termination The simplest thing would be just to charge some batteries and log to the computer. There&rsquo;s a marvellous thing out there called FeedGnuPlot which makes graphing realtime or static data so easy one has to resist the temptation to graph everything.

As part of the Battery Charger project I need a basic PIC dev board. I built one a long time ago for A2 coursework, and I even found the artwork lying around, but the tracks and pads were too small for hand etching and drilling. Trying to open the cad files in KiCad I discovered that they&rsquo;ve changed everything, and half the symbols &lsquo;cannot be found&rsquo;. I&rsquo;ve also completely forgotten how to use KiCad or schematic capture/Pcb design software in general: all pointing to a need to redraw.

There are lots of &lsquo;smart&rsquo; chargers out there. Most of them boast that they can charge your batteries quicker than the competition, and that a &lsquo;smart&rsquo; algorithm will somehow prevent packing as much current as possible into a cell in the shortest time from having deleterious effects. Slow chargers are harder to come by: there are the cheap constant-current things you run for a certain amount of time—but if your batteries are not absolutely dead they will overcharge, and probably overheat and explode, as mine did.

Embedded Linux is currently all the rage with little boards like the Pi running a full-fledged Debian just to flash a few LEDs. Now certainly, the Pi would find uses here, but it&rsquo;s hardly cheap. What is cheap—or even free—is defunct wireless routers. They, too, are embedded systems running Linux. Unlike the Pi they have on-board wifi and an ethernet switch; the cpu isn&rsquo;t usually too bad either. I also picked a few up for £0.

About five years ago now I stopped dreaming of a proper bench vice and built one from some old oak kitchen doors I rescued from a skip, an old oak drawer, and long M6 bolts.
Some day if I find the pictures I might write it up as an example of how not to do it: I dovetailed the two runners on in opposite directions and a whole host of other things.

This posed something of a problem: what do you do when a pinned tenon breaks? The joint was too broken just to glue, neither surface was flat, and the dowels were in the way. In the end I decided to dowel it with three dowls, to leave as much of the broken tenon intact as possible. Dowled joints are easy on flat, square workpeices. On jagged tapering workpeices, now&mldr; With a quarter-inch chisel I cut flats to mark on and marked the three holes on both mortice and tenon.
