I can build a simple current regulator with an LM317 and a resistor, which will be good enough for now.
No Termination The simplest thing would be just to charge some batteries and log to the computer. There&amp;rsquo;s a marvellous thing out there called FeedGnuPlot which makes graphing realtime or static data so easy one has to resist the temptation to graph everything.</description></item><item><title>Background</title><link>https://2e0byo.github.io/post/electronics/battery-charger/background/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jul 2018 12:50:36 +0000</pubDate><author>2e0byo@gmail.com (John Morris)</author><guid>https://2e0byo.github.io/post/electronics/battery-charger/background/</guid><description>There are lots of &amp;lsquo;smart&amp;rsquo; chargers out there. Most of them boast that they can charge your batteries quicker than the competition, and that a &amp;lsquo;smart&amp;rsquo; algorithm will somehow prevent packing as much current as possible into a cell in the shortest time from having deleterious effects. Slow chargers are harder to come by: there are the cheap constant-current things you run for a certain amount of timeâ€”but if your batteries are not absolutely dead they will overcharge, and probably overheat and explode, as mine did.</description></item></channel></rss>
