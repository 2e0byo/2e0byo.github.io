The original controller only switches four of these on the board (the superfreeze is a manual switch), and uses triacs for all except the compressor, which has a 10A relay. Of course, that requires the controller to be attached to the AC neutral, which isn&amp;rsquo;t a great idea with exposed hardware like a prototype balanced on a fridge.</description></item><item><title>Reverse Engineering a Fridge</title><link>https://2e0byo.github.io/post/engineering/reverse-engineering-fridge/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jan 2021 20:36:37 +0000</pubDate><author>2e0byo@gmail.com (John Morris)</author><guid>https://2e0byo.github.io/post/engineering/reverse-engineering-fridge/</guid><description>We have a Hotpoint FFA52 fridge-freezer. It has previously given much hardship. It no longer works. Here is a graph of a non-working freezer:
I don&amp;rsquo;t mind a bit of swing in the temperature, but that&amp;rsquo;s all over the place. In the meantime the fridge compartment turned into a freezer, albeit not a very good one. Time to take it apart and see what the problem could be.</description></item><item><title>How to Move a Piano</title><link>https://2e0byo.github.io/post/engineering/how-to-move-a-piano/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jan 2020 20:07:44 +0000</pubDate><author>2e0byo@gmail.com (John Morris)</author><guid>https://2e0byo.github.io/post/engineering/how-to-move-a-piano/</guid><description>Moving is not much fun. Moving pianos is even less fun: you have all the difficulty of moving a 300kg object coupled with the worry that you&amp;rsquo;ll twist it out of shape, drop it, strain it, or just shake it too much.
Moving, however, just round the corner—700yds, according to Google—is at least easier than moving halfway round the world. But moving a piano 700yds is not apparently any easier than moving it 300 miles: you can&amp;rsquo;t wheel it, not on those little coasters, or even on a furniture dolly.</description></item><item><title>Piano Tuning Lever</title><link>https://2e0byo.github.io/post/engineering/piano-tuning-lever/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Dec 2018 11:05:15 +0000</pubDate><author>2e0byo@gmail.com (John Morris)</author><guid>https://2e0byo.github.io/post/engineering/piano-tuning-lever/</guid><description>I have a piano to tune. And also to restore: a few hammer shafts to bend, hammers to file, a bit of crud to clean out, bridle straps to replace, etc, etc. The piano cost £40 from Ebay and is in remarkably good nick, and any piano is better than none! But an out of tune piano is no good.
Now students, I feel, should not really spend money having their pianos tuned&amp;mdash;at least, not students of Theology.</description></item></channel></rss>
