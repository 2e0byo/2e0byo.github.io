There are many drawings, etc, all over the internet. My press is a little different: I used old windowsill &amp;lsquo;mahogany&amp;rsquo;, and took advantage of the profile to make one side a &amp;lsquo;backing press&amp;rsquo; with protruding jaws planed away after a picture I found in an old book somewhere.</description></item></channel></rss>
