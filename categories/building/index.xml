Unfortunately when we moved in the torched on felt (the proper three-layer system) had died in a large part, and water could make its way inside. Thus it needed re-roofing.
Now, whilst I have no experience roofing beyond tacking down felt on wooden roofs (which is infinitely simpler than what ended up happening), I immediately decided to volunteer to re-roof it if the landlord would pay.</description></item></channel></rss>
